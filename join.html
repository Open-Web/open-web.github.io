            <h1>Become a part of the team</h1>
            <p>
            Interested in joining Open Web? Great! We are always looking for dedicated people to join our team.
            </p>
            <p>
            We're looking for students with various backgrounds, but mostly developers and designers. We expect people to have at least some prior experience unless you're extremely motivated and can learn fast (we're here to teach you!). We're looking both for people with apps ideas and students who just want to join one of our projects.
            </p>
            <p>
            Being an Open Web member is a lot of work, so you should <strong>be ready to dedicate about 10 hours per week</strong>. It may seem like a lot, but the payoffs will be huge. You'll have the opportunity to create amazing apps and websites, pitch your own ideas, and make new friends!</p>
            <p>
            Applying consists of 2 parts: an application form and a small project. You can fill out an application <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/4DUTVekc0bQLUqh92" target="_blank">here</a>, and we'll be in touch shortly with the next steps.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you have any questions, you can email us at <a href="mailto:openweb@bu.edu">openweb@bu.edu</a>.
