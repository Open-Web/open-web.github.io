            <h2>Become a part of the team</h2>
            <p>
            Interested in joining Open Web? Great! We always look for interesting people to join our team.
            </p>
            <p>
            First, let's set expectations clear. We're looking for students with various backgrounds, but mostly developers and designers. We expect people to have at least some prior experience unless you're extremely motivated and can learn fast (we're here to teach you!). We're looking both for people with apps ideas, and students who just want to join one of our projects.
            </p>
            <p>
            Being an Open Web member is a lot of work, so you should <b>be ready to dedicate hours</b>. It's gonna be around 10 hours per week. Yes, it's a lot. But payoffs will be huge. So make sure that you're ready for this.
            </p>
